# Hacker and Builder

I seek to understand systemsâ€”not just how they work, but how they can be made to work differently.

My interest lies in the culmination of 2 million years of human progress: the field of science and the systems we've built. Through understanding comes a simple question: **Can I make it work in a way it's not expected to work?**

Currently top 10% on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/0xzrf). Cybersecurity remains a useful skill to develop.

I also watch anime.
