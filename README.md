## ðŸš€ About Me

My motivation for learning is to just explore what is out there in the field of scienceâ€”the very thing humanity worked 2 million years to get to where we are. All I want is deep understanding of all and everything, including computer systems.

And through the understanding of systems, comes the question: **"CAN I MAKE IT WORK IN A WAY IT'S NOT EXPECTED TO WORK?"**

## ðŸ”’ Cybersecurity Journey

I've been in the **top 10%** of hackers on the TryHackMe platform, and I'm still learning cybersecurityâ€”more like a hobby that turned into a passion.
